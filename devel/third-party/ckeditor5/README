RT uses CKEditor 5 as the editor for ticket updates. The following instructions describe how to create a new build. More information can also be found here:

https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html

1) Get the base package. We use the classic build as a base.

$ git clone https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic.git

2) Install dependencies from npm.

$ cd ckeditor5-build-classic
$ npm install

3) Copy the RT ckeditor.js config file into the src directory.

$ cp ../ckeditor.js src/

4) Install other optional packages.

$ npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-alignment
$ npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm
$ npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-font
$ npm install @ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format

5) The build process uses webpack and yarn, so install those.

$ npm install webpack
$ npm install yarn

6) Run the build

$ ./node_modules/yarn/bin/yarn run build

7) After running the build, the build directory will have the updated ckeditor.js file and translation files. Copy these updated files to RT's CKEditor directory.

$ cp build/ckeditor.js ../../../../share/static/RichText5/
$ cp -R build/translations ../../../../share/static/RichText5/
