RT uses CKEditor 5 as the editor for ticket updates. The following instructions describe how to create a new build. More information can also be found here:

https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/quick-start-other.html#customizing-builds

1) Install Node.js and npm

If you are on MacOSX, the most straightforward way to install Node.js and npm is to use Homebrew:

    $ brew install node

2) Build CKEditor 5

    $ cd devel/third_party/ckeditor5
    $ npm install
    $ npm run build

3) After running the build, the build directory will have the updated ckeditor.js file and translation files. Copy these updated files to RT's CKEditor directory.

    $ cp build/ckeditor.js ../../../share/static/RichText5/ckeditor.min.js
    $ cp -R build/translations ../../../share/static/RichText5/
